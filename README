NAME
    Games::Poker::Omaha::Hutchison - Hutchison method for scoring Omaha
    hands

SYNOPSIS
            my $evaluator = Games::Poker::Omaha::Hutchison->new("Ah Qd 3s 1d");

            my $score = $evaluator->hand_score;

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements the Hutchison Omaha Point System for evaluating
    starting hands in Omaha poker, as described at
    http://www.thepokerforum.com/omahasystem.htm

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
            my $evaluator = Games::Poker::Omaha::Hutchison->new("Ah Qd Ts 3d");

    This takes 4 cards, expresed as a single string. The 'pip value' of the
    card should be 2-9,T,J,Q,K or A, and the suit, of course, s, h, c or d.

METHODS
  hand_score
            my $score = $evaluator->hand_score;

    This returns the number of points assigned to the hand by this System.
    This figure is roughly equivalent to the percentage chance of this
    turning into a winning hand in a 10 player game, where each player plays
    until the end. See the URL above for more information.

  flush_score / pair_score / straight_score
    The final hand_score() is made up from three component scores, for
    suited cards, paired cards, and straight cards. These component scores
    can also be accessed individually.
